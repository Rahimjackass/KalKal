Update
- start date can be specified while game creation, like schedule of Booking. It can help to make the game duration more clear for users.
- a new game mode: after selecting the target crypto, game duration needs to be specified ( during a same duration over a same crypto ), then the user who guess a number ( as a percentage ) closer to the real coin's price change over the specified duration wins the price.
- a button can be added to the game page which serves as an extra service. Users can pay a fixed price and see who is the winner of the game so far
